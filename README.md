It has an editor for writing and running FF3 Script files.

FF32 Scripting is a simple scripting langue to controll all the ff32 functions.

It can cotroll all the pins, as well as analog in, PWM, SPI, I2C and 1Wire

A blinking LED script looks like this;

This will blink a LED on pin A1 every second
